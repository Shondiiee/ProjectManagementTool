## Project Description

This is a web-based project management application built using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
The system allows users to collaborate on projects by creating tasks, assigning them to team members, tracking progress and communicating through comments.
The application features a modern, Trello-inspired interface with a display board for visual task management.
Users can register accounts, create projects, invite team members, and manage tasks with statuses (To-Do, In Progress, Done).
Additional features added include task assignments, due dates with overdue warnings and a commenting system for team collaborations.
